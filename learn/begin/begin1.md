## Let's Begin 

Code is what makes computer work for us, but before we learn how to code, we should begin by understanding what a computer is. In a literal meaning, a computer is a device that can calculate. Modern computers can do so much more than calculate though! They allow us to create documents, presentations, emails, connect with loved ones accross the globe, and use the web to find and share information. To best summarize how this is all possible, let's review the IPO (Input-Process-Output) model.

#### The Input-Process-Output Model
Modern computers (desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, cars, fridges, smart watches) all share a model in which they operate: **The Input-Process-Output Model**. 

##### Input (Data)
In the context of coding, input is data. In the context of programming, a computer receives input (data) through the user or other sources. Upon receiving input, the computer follows code that provides it with instructions on how to process the input.

##### Process (Code)
Before the computer can do anything with input, it needs to process the data. In the context of coding, processing data is following the instructions in the code written to process input. The instructions allow the computer to understand how to categorize, format, store, transform, and display data. Without code (the instructions) to process the input (data) there is nothing the computer can do.

- A mouse click
    - Your computer can process the data received by the a mouse click by processing code that outputs what the location of the mouse click was to know if a button or empty space was clicked and output a new element or request additional input.
- Pressing a key on your keyboard
    - Your computer can process the data received by pressing one or multiple keys on your keyboard by processing code that instructs the computer what should be output after key or keys were pressed on the keyboard.
- Touching your screen
    - Your computer can process the data received by touching your screen by processing code that instructs the computer what output to provide when certain elements on the screen are touched, dragged, or swiped.

##### Output (The Result of Code)
After the computer has processed the input, it will provide output. In the context of coding, output is what is presented to the user through the a display, printer, program, or web page, or it could be additional data that is then processed by another piece of code.

##### The Input-Process-Output Model In Action
To help you contextualize how this Input-Process-Ouput model works, here are some examples:

###### A Mouse Click
- Input (data): The computer receives where you clicked or where your mouse cursor is currently at.
- Process (code): The computer processes code that instructs it what to output if a button or empty space was cliked.
- Output (result): The computer closes the current window because it processes that the close window button was clicked.

###### A Key Or Multiple Keys Are Pressed On The Keyboard
- Input (data): The computer receives what key(s) you pressed.
- Process (code): The computer processes code that instructs it what to do if a key is pressed.
- Output (result):
