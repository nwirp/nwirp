### Computer Basics

Code is what makes computer work for us, but before we learn how to code, we should begin by understanding what a computer is. In a literal meaning, a computer is a device that can calculate. Modern computers can do so much more than calculate though! They allow us to create documents, presentations, emails, connect with loved ones accross the globe, and use the web to find and share information. To best summarize how this is all possible, let's review the IPO (Input-Process-Output) model.

#### The Input-Process-Output Model
Modern computers (desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, cars, fridges, smart watches) all share a model in which they operate: **The Input-Process-Output Model**. 

##### Input (Data)
In computing, input is data. In the context of programming, a computer receives input through the user or other sources. Some examples that may help you contextualize input are:
- A mouse click
    - The data (input) in this example  can be where you clicked or where your mouse cursor is currently at.
- Pressing a key or keys on your keyboard
    - The data (input) in this example can be the key(s) you pressed, or what you typed.
- Touching your screen
    - The data (input) in this example can be where you touched the screen, how many fingers are on the screen, or where each finger is at.

##### Process (Code)
Before the computer can do anything with input, it needs to process the data. In the context of programming, this is where code matters. Code will allow the computer to understand how to categorize, format, store, transform, and display data. Without code to process the input (data) there is nothing the computer can do. Some examples of how code handles input are:

- A mouse click
    - Your computer can process the data received by the a mouse click by processing code that outputs what the location of the mouse click was to know if a button or empty space was clicked and output a new element or request additional input.
- Pressing a key on your keyboard
    - Your computer can process the data received by pressing one or multiple keys on your keyboard by processing code that instructs the computer what should be output after key or keys were pressed on the keyboard.
- Touching your screen
    - Your computer can process the data received by touching your screen by processing code that instructs the computer what output to provide when certain elements on the screen are touched, dragged, or swiped.

##### Output (The Result of Code)
After the computer has processed the input, it will provide output. Output is provided by the computer after being constructed by code. In the context of programming, output is what is presented to the user through the a display, printer, program, or web page.
