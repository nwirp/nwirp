# Learn With NWIRP

Through this document, NWIRP strives to make access to coding tools easy and accessible for you. Our goal is not only to assist you in learning how to contribute to our work, but also to empower community with the knowledge to build the tools they need. This guide is written with the assumption that you have no prior coding experience. If you need additional guidance on terms, or instructions given in this guide, please submit an issue

It's not always clear, but coding is fundamentally about empowerment. No matter what problem you are trying to solve with a computer, code empowers you to utilize your computer to its full capacity by skipping layers and layers of abstraction and communicating to it's brain directly.

If you don't know how to code or never felt the desire to do it before, there's probably a million reasons you weren't able to do so before. Let's appreciate that you are now able to explore this field! Please do not let any mistake or insecurity prevent you from embarking on this journey. Anybody can code, and in the next section I hope to convince you of your capacity to use your imagination and ingenuity to help NWIRP and your communities build tools that impact your world.
