# Welcome

The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project **('NWIRP')** knows that utilizing technology is more than just being able to read and write lines of code. It is a vital part of empowering and helping community. We invite you to contribute to our work, learn new things, and help us utilize and create technology to help keep families together, protect people from violence, and stand up to injustice.
