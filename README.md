# Contribute

The Northwest Immigrant Rights Porject ('NWIRP'), as an orgnization, knows that utilizing technology is more than just being able to read and write lines of code. It is a vital part of ensuring our mission's success. We have created this repository to invite you to contribute to our work and provide you with the guidelines to contribute to our source code and use it to help keep families together, protect people from violence, and stand up to injustice.

You do not have to be a developer, engineer, lawyer, or wizard (although wizards are highly encouraged to join) to contribute to any of our projects. Our goal is to ensure that contributing to our work is as accessible as possible. A lot of people with many different skills contribute to all our projects: our software, IT infrastructure, the artwork, this and other documentation are the results of a joint effort by our community. If you'd like to contribute, here are some suggestions with link to their corresponding guidelines:

## Coding and Maintaining Software

Have you ever wanted to write a new application from scratch, or maybe help us implement a new feature in an existing application? If you're a developer and want to contribute by writing code, helping maintain our applications, add new features to existing application, or help us engineer new applications please view our development guidelines to learn more fill out our volunteer form.

## Testing and Bug Squashing

There is no such things as bug free software. We value your input and feedback in letting us know when something is not working as expected. You can use any of our project's issues page to report bugs or help us find solutions to reported bugs.

Please see our development guidelines if you need help on reporting or viewing issues with our code.

## Writing Documentation and Commenting Projects

Do you enjoy writing? Reliable documentation and comments are a vital aspect of software development. The presence of documentation helps keep track of all aspects of an application and the presence of comments improves the quality, readability, and maintainability of our code.

If you enjoy writing or are able to understand how certain code works, you can help us by writing or editing documentation and commenting our code. Please see our documentation guidelines to learn more and fill out our volunteer form.
