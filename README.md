## About the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project ('NWIRP')

### Our Mission

Northwest Immigrant Rights Project promotes justice by defending and advancing the rights of immigrants through direct legal services, systemic advocacy, and community education.

### Our Story

Northwest Immigrant Rights Project began in response to an emergency. Hundreds of thousands of Central Americans were fleeing the political repression and violence of civil wars to seek safety and asylum in the United States. But once they arrived, they found they were not welcome.

The government did not want to offer the refugees asylum. They did not want to offer them safety. Instead, these refugees faced immigration authorities bent on sending them right back to war and persecution. Not only did they have no legal right to representation, most didn’t have money to hire a lawyer. They were forced to confront the threat and reality of deportation alone.

The refugees needed safe-haven. Many churches around the country began giving shelter to Central American refugees – in open defiance of federal law. They called this response the Sanctuary Movement. In Seattle, several local churches joined the Sanctuary Movement. Hundreds of Central Americans found refuge within the walls of churches around Seattle and the State. But they were not protected. Without legal representation, many of them would be deported back to the chaos and violence of Central America.

A small group gathered together united in their determination to fight for justice and legal protection for the Central Americans seeking safety in the United States. Together, they mobilized volunteer attorneys to defend the rights of these refugees in their search for asylum.

After the passage of the Immigration Control and Reform Act, there were immigrants and refugees from all over the world who desperately needed legal representation and advocacy if they were to receive the benefits of this new law. This new legislation, coupled with this new group's desire to help people from all countries, officially started the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.

### Our Values and Principles

#### 1. Dignity

We all deserve to have our human dignity and fundamental rights respected.

#### 2. Fairness

Laws and policies should be fair and equitable. When liberty or fundamental rights are at stake, all people are entitled to meaningful due process and competent legal representation

#### 3. Solidarity

We are connected by our common humanity, by global forces that affect our lives, and by historic patterns of oppression, discrimination and inequity. For society to be just and whole, we must work together to undo systemic oppression in its many forms.

#### 4. Self-Determination

Society thrives when all people have opportunities to live their lives to their fullest potential.

#### 5. Safety

People and communities thrive when we all feel and experience safety. Safety should never be used to justify oppression.

#### 6. Inclusion

We see diversity and inclusiveness as a source of strength.

### About Our Services

#### Legal Services

NWIRP's legal services are critical to helping thousands of immigrants in Washington State navigate the complexities of the United States immigration system so they can apply for asylum or other forms of immigration protection. Without appropriate legal assistance, the men, women and children served by NWIRP may be less likely to obtain legal immigration status, and more likely to be returned to a country where they face ill treatment, torture, or even death.

Access to NWIRP's services can also be a major factor in providing economic and personal security. Without legal support, our clients are often unable to access medical assistance, housing or other basic services, and many of them are afraid to call the police for protection from domestic violence or other crimes.

##### Survivors of Domestic Violence & Other Crimes

The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Unit, or Domestic Violence Unit, provides direct representation to immigrant survivors of violence seeking immigration benefits. While the VAWA Unit handles several hundred immigration cases per year, the demand for assistance continues to be greater than the available resources meaning there is a long waitlist for clients seeking help.

The primary types of cases handled by the VAWA Unit include: U Visa Petitions; T Visa Petitions; VAWA Self-Petitions; and Petitions for Waiver to Remove Conditions on Residency; as well as Removal (Deportation) Defense in Immigration Court. The VAWA Unit collaborates very closely with other Domestic Violence Agencies in the region.

##### Asylum

We defend the rights of people who have a fear of persecution in their home country and help them gain safety through asylum. The asylum unit also assists pro se applicants with navigating the asylum application process and works with outside agencies, communities, and organizations to promote the rights and dignity of and offer support services to persons fleeing persecution in their home countries.

##### Family Services

NWIRP keeps families together by assisting with family visa applications and representing family members facing deportation.

The FSU processes hundreds of cases each year. Once a month, in Seattle, a Family Visa Workshop is provided for up to 40 people to attend a 40-minute presentation on a general overview of the family-based petition process. If you live in western Washington, contact NWIRP’s main line at (206) 587-4009 to sign up for a Family Visa Workshop and intake. If you live in eastern Washington, please contact the Granger office at (509) 854-2100 or the Wenatchee office at (509) 570-0054, for individual intakes.

##### Children & Youth

Some immigrant children face poverty, lack of parental support, illiteracy, lack of proper nutrition, lack of access to education in their home country, prior trauma, abuse and neglect. Immigrant children who face these issues are especially vulnerable because they have difficulty advocating for themselves.

##### Citizenship

We help immigrants obtain United States Citizenship. Immigrant rights include the right to become a U.S. citizen after satisfying the requirements as a lawful permanent resident. In general, an immigrant can apply to become a U.S. citizen five years after they become a lawful permanent resident (or 3 years if they are married to a U.S. citizen). However, they must demonstrate that they have good moral character (no disqualifying criminal record), and that they can pass a test demonstrating an ability to read, write and speak in English, and a knowledge of the U.S. government (unless they qualify for a disability waiver). By becoming citizens persons can now fully participate in civic life, with the right to vote in federal, state and local elections. In addition, they have greater rights in filing petitions to reunite with family members. Finally, they are also secure from being deported.

##### Detention & Deportation Defense

We believe that people should not be incarcerated in immigration detention centers, and that all people are entitled to competent and meaningful legal representation. We take on a variety of cases, representing people who are recent arrivals to the United States as well as those who have been in the country for many years. Our clients include survivors of domestic violence, trafficking, and torture, as well as people who have been convicted of crimes. We also take cases that are challenging in order to make sure we are making a meaningful impact for our clients and their families.

#### Community Education

##### Know Your Rights

Our "Know Your Rights" Presentations are directed at community members who are interested in learning more about their legal rights. We cover a variety of topics including what to do if you or someone you know if approached by a police officer or immigration official, how the latest executive actions on immigration may affect you or members of your community, and a basic introduction to the United States' immigration system. These presentations are conducted by NWIRP legal staff members and are primarily offered in Spanish. You can find a list of all our upcoming Know Your Rights presentations by visiting the events page of our website.

##### Immigration 101 Training for Service Providers

NWIRP provides training for service providers such as teachers, healthcare professionals, domestic violence advocates, social service providers, and others who may serve the immigrant community as part of their work. These sessions answer questions that community members may have about the immigration system, immigration enforcement, and how immigration issues affect the communities they serve. Our Immigration 101 Training includes an overview of the immigration system and immigration status as well as which resources are available in the community.

##### Legal Orientation Presentations at the Northwest Detention Center

Individuals in immigration court have no right to an attorney if they cannot afford to pay for one. At the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, where 1,300 individuals are detained while they await immigration court, many cannot afford a private attorney.

NWIRP's Tacoma office has been able to provide limited legal assistance to tens of thousands of detainees at the Northwest Detention Center who cannot afford private legal representation. Since 2005, NWIRP has received funding through the U.S. Department of Justice to operate the Legal Orientation Program (LOP) at the facility. Through the LOP portion of their work, NWIRP's Tacoma staff provide group orientations that inform detainees about their legal rights, their legal options, and about what they can expect when they appear in court. The LOP also allows NWIRP to provide individual orientations and workshops to pro se detainees to assist with their applications for relief from deportation.

#### Impact Litigation

When laws and policies are unjust, we work for systemic change. During the last decade, we have positively affected many important cases with implications for national immigration laws. Our impact litigation work has helped fight racial profiling by border patrol officials in the Olympic Peninsula, secured the right to an attorney for mentally ill immigrants facing deportation, and ensured that immigrants are considered for conditional parole from detention when they qualify.

To respond to the growth of immigration appeals at the Federal and Ninth District Courts, we increased our focus in this area by establishing a new legal unit in 2005. At any one time, the Impact Litigation Unit has several cases pending before the federal courts. NWIRP was invited by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to speak at a roundtable discussion on how to deal with the Circuit's large volume of immigration cases.
